# Housecleaning
Have Ruby installed on your machine. Have at least Ruby 2.0.0.
A text editor. Although you should already have one.
You should have completed Try Ruby on CodeSchool. It will take you like 15 minutes, so just do it. And why's poignant guide to Ruby. Seriously, these are fun.
That's it. That's all we need.

# History of Ruby
Ruby is thought of as a new programming language, by actually was created by a developer named Matz in 1994. He was a fan of Perl and wanted to create a language that was flexible and powerful and had an expressive and human readable syntax. Since Matz was based in Japan, there wasn't really any documentation in English (it was all in Japanese). Dave Thomas, a pioneer of agile programming, loved Ruby and created The Pickaxe book. Then Ruby began to grow, and was popular among system administrators.

Everything in Ruby is an object. Everything. What does this mean? Please explain it.
